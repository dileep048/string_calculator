# String Calculator (TDD) - React Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `Introduction`

This project implements a String Calculator using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The calculator allows you to sum up comma or newline-separated numbers. It also supports custom delimiters and throws errors for negative numbers.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of TDD, React for the frontend, and Jest for testing.
